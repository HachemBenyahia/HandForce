# HandForce
Handforce is a poker software which gives the "force" of a poker hand in online games. It was originally designed for PokerStars games. 
HandForce is published under the **GNU GPL license**.

The software was developed with C++ and SDL 1.2. It is very easy to use, you just launch the `.exe` with all the proper DLLs and you'll
get a small screen that will give you the force of the current hand in the current window you're playing in in real time.

Though a professional player may be able to play on multiple tables at the same time and still be able to read his hand very quickly, an
average player who still wants to be successful in poker may have difficulties playing with more than 2-3 tables at the same time given the
few milliseconds he has to take a decision. HandForce shortens that time by analyzing the current hand for him, thus allowing him to play
on more tables at the same time.

This software was created by Hachem Benyahia.
